Here are the step-by-step instructions to set up the `goxpyriment` group with those high-priority privileges.

---

### Step 1: Create the Group
First, you need to create the group in the system database.

```bash
sudo groupadd goxpyriment
```

### Step 2: Create the Limits Configuration
Linux stores these specific "privilege" rules in `/etc/security/limits.d/`. You should create a new file specifically for your group so it doesn't mess with other system settings.

1.  **Open a new config file:**
    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/security/limits.d/99-goxpyriment.conf
    ```
2.  **Paste the following lines into the file:**
    ```text
    @goxpyriment - nice -20
    @goxpyriment - rtprio 50
    @goxpyriment - memlock unlimited
    ```
3.  **Save and Exit:** Press `Ctrl + O`, then `Enter` to save, and `Ctrl + X` to exit.

### Step 3: Add Yourself (and others) to the Group
Simply creating the group isn't enough; you have to tell Linux which users belong to it. Replace `$USER` with a specific username if you are adding someone else.

```bash
sudo usermod -aG goxpyriment $USER
```

### Step 4: Apply the Changes
**Important:** Linux only checks group memberships and limits when a user **logs in**. 

* You **must** log out of your Linux session and log back in.
* Alternatively, you can run `su - $USER` in your terminal to start a sub-shell with the new permissions for testing.

### How to Verify it Worked
Once you’ve logged back in, you can verify that your Go program (or any process) will have these rights.

**1. Check Group Membership:**
Run the command `groups`. You should see `goxpyriment` in the list.

**2. Check the Memory Lock Limit:**
Run this command to see your current "Max locked memory" limit:
```bash
ulimit -l
```
If it says **`unlimited`**, you are good to go!

**3. Check Real-Time Priority:**
Run:
```bash
ulimit -r
```
It should return **`50`**.

### ⚠️ A Friendly "Warning"
Since you are giving your code the ability to run at `-20` niceness (the highest possible priority), a "busy loop" in your Go code (like `for { }` without a sleep) could potentially **freeze your entire desktop**. 

Because your code is now more "important" than the mouse driver or the window manager, the OS won't interrupt your code to let you click "Stop." Always keep a terminal open with a `top` or `htop` window ready, or test your logic with lower priority first!
